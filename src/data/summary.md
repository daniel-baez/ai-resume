I am a Chilean software engineer who learned to code early in life and have spent the past 16 years cultivating a career defined by curiosity and impact. My experience spans a diverse range of technical challenges—from developing web, mobile and cloud-native solutions, to social and financial networks, while building scalable software platforms and designing complex IoT architectures. As a generalist, I excel in adapting to evolving tech landscapes, I’m equipped to manage Unix-based systems with ease. My deep exposure to cloud elastic infrastructures has equipped me to optimize product reliability and operational excellence across the stack.

Throughout my career, I’ve thrived in environments that hustle for success and embrace rapid iteration driven by data. I’ve held roles from individual contributor to technical leader, all driven by a commitment to crafting software that meets real-world needs and withstands the test of scale and complex business demands. To me, software engineering is both a craft and a mission that I live with passion.
