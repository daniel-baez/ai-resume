My time at Fitbit offered invaluable experience with global-scale architectures—the largest platform I’ve worked on so far. I gained hands-on exposure to industry-standard practices for Kafka and large-scale deployments over distributed systems like Mesos, a precursor to Kubernetes.

Together with the team, I was responsible for managing and optimizing critical services during high-demand periods, including Thanksgiving and Christmas, ensuring stability and scalability under heavy traffic.

We also developed a tool called SIMPL—a web interface that streamlined microservice development with guided, wizard-like workflows. SIMPL accelerated development across the company and improved maintainability by serving as a central source of truth for software artifact ownership.
