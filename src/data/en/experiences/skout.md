SKOUT marked a transition in my career where I moved from Chile to San Francisco, embracing the opportunity to work closely with a team on core backend development. 

One of my notable achievements was leading an overhaul of the messaging system, introducing a "chat request" feature that enhanced user experience by filtering unwanted communications.

I also fortified our security architecture by re-engineering login and signup protocols, these updates made possible to incorporate AI-driven verifications and CAPTCHA to bolster user safety. These projects not only showcased my technical acumen but also underscored my commitment to creating scalable and user-focused software solutions.
