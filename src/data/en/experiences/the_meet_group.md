Working at The Meet Group was a fast-paced, high-impact experience where I honed my skills in system integration and technical leadership. [I joined](https://www.themeetgroup.com/blog/the-meet-group-acquires-skout) just as the company had completed a major acquisition (SKOUT was acquired by TMG), which brought unique challenges in unifying and overhauling systems to meet higher performance and scalability requirements.

I played a key role in this integration effort, working on critical updates to ensure seamless functionality across platforms and services. This experience gave me a solid foundation in system migrations and the intricacies of aligning distinct tech stacks under one cohesive architecture.

Beyond technical contributions, I also took on responsibilities in recruitment and mentorship. I helped shape a team culture that valued innovation and technical excellence, actively recruiting new talent and providing guidance to junior engineers.

My time at The Meet Group taught me the importance of adaptability and collaboration, especially in a rapidly evolving environment. This role solidified my ability to lead complex projects and strengthened my commitment to delivering impactful, high-quality software solutions.
