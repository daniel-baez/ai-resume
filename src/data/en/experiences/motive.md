Motive has taught me more than any other company. From the start, I believed in our mission. As a Chilean and avid reader of my country’s recent history, I quickly recognized the critical role of goods and services distribution in upholding the social contract.

I joined when our team was small—about 40 engineers working closely with the CTO in downtown San Francisco. Those early days were very inspiring.
Starting as an individual contributor, I implemented essential updates to our core systems. My first project was creating a cache layer to relieve our primary database, a solution that’s still operational after five years, handling tens of thousands of requests per second during peak periods.

Later, I focused on key backend improvements to maintain performance and reliability, such as implementing connection pooling for I/O resources like Redis and establishing a feature flagging practice for safe, low-impact feature releases—a practice that soon became standard across the company.
As we expanded, our monolithic “platform” team split into specialized teams. I transitioned to the IoT Platform team, which is crucial as we are primarily an IoT company.

In this role, I quickly adapted to IoT technologies and am now responsible for several key services, including the configuration platform, which ensures accurate device setups. I enhanced this platform to support client-facing features, such as customizing device configurations for different fleets—a feature we call Event Customization. Additional user applications are also supported on this platform.

I have also been a key player in upgrading our data ingestion infrastructure, maintaining our remote file ingestion pipeline, which processes millions of files weekly and serves as one of our primary data ingestion channels, powering many client-facing features.
